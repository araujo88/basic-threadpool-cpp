# Thread pool

Implementing a thread pool in C++ involves creating a fixed number of threads that can execute any number of tasks queued by the main thread or any other thread. The basic idea is to have a work queue and a pool of threads that continually check this queue for available work. When a task is available, a thread from the pool will execute it. Once completed, the thread will check the queue for the next task, continuing this process until the program ends or the pool is stopped.

- ThreadPool Constructor: Initializes the specified number of worker threads. Each worker runs in an infinite loop, where it waits for tasks to be available in the queue. When a task is available, it is executed, and the worker then waits for the next task.
- enqueue Function: Allows adding tasks to the queue. It wraps the task into a std::packaged_task to allow returning a future that can be used to wait for the task's completion and retrieve its result.
- ThreadPool Destructor: Signals all threads to stop and joins them to ensure that all tasks are completed before the thread pool is destroyed.

This basic thread pool implementation can be a good starting point for executing tasks concurrently in C++. Depending on your requirements, you might need to add features, such as handling exceptions within tasks, allowing for task priorities, or dynamically adjusting the number of threads in the pool.
